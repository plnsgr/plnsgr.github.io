# Zogulon Traces

## Description
Quick!! Chase K has been abducted! He will surely be turned into a Zogulon if we don't find him in time. All I could find was this encoder for their hyperspace drive and this letter. There are likely clues everywhere, be meticulous!!

The Zogulon Collective, has taken Chase K and transformed him into something beyond your understanding. He is lost to you now, never to return.

With indifference,
The Zogulon Collective

- Dump the .TRACES_OF_THE_ZOGULAN and extract the hex of it:

```

└─$ objdump -s -j .TRACES_OF_THE_ZOGULAN hyperdrive_encoder.elf

hyperdrive_encoder.elf:     file format elf64-x86-64

Contents of section .TRACES_OF_THE_ZOGULAN:
 0000 52a799d1 13de948d fb5f59a9 c0480347  R........_Y..H.G
 0010 a1d1dc6a 84d8851d 6b21               ...j....k!


Generate the time into hash
Python script:
from datetime import datetime

timestamp = datetime(2025, 3, 17, 0, 5, 50)

seed = int(timestamp.timestamp())
print(hex(seed))
#0x67e012be
```

- decompile and make a script to decode it by reversing it:

```
└─$ cat script.py
from datetime import datetime

def glorbus_florbus(a1, a2):
    return (
        a1 * a1 * (a2 % 0xA + a1 - 5)
        + (a2 % 0xA + a1 - 3) * a1 * a1 * a1
        + ((a2 % 0xA + a1 - 7) * a1)
    ) & 0xFF

def decode(encoded_hex, seed):
    encoded_bytes = bytes.fromhex(encoded_hex)
    decoded_bytes = []
    for i in range(len(encoded_bytes)):
        decoded_bytes.append(encoded_bytes[i] ^ glorbus_florbus(i, seed))
    return bytes(decoded_bytes).decode("utf-8", errors="replace")

def main():
    encoded_output = "52a799d113de948dfb5f59a9c0480347a1d1dc6a84d8851d6b21"
    seed = 0x67e012be
    decoded_message = decode(encoded_output, seed)
    print("Decoded Message:", decoded_message)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

- The output will be:

```
└─$ python script.py
Decoded Message: RS{37.233333, -115.808333}
```

Flag: `RS{37.233333, -115.808333}`
